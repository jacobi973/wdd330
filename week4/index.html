        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> For our team assignments it was interesting to see how things could be targeted by the event. This lead
                to being able to get the correct cell that we were trying for.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Object oriented programming is a great way to learn how to use classes and objects. Some of the ones I
                still am trying to understand better are prototypal inheritance and the use of the this keyword, as well
                encapsulation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>This is the first time if have read of mixins and how the object.assign works with it instead of
                inheritance.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The keyword this is used to refer to the current object. It is used to access the properties and methods
                of the object.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> With web applications are MVC models common?
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>With the usage of modules the keyword module has to be used for js.scripts. However, when I am trying to use a function in the html that resides in my js file, I get an error.
                I have tried to import the module into the html file and it still does not work. Could you show an example of how to use the module keyword and functions inside the html with it?
            </li>
