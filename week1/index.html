        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When designing websites the world has changed from a desktop/laptop world to a mobile device world.
                This in turn leads to the fact that we need to change the way we thing and build websites.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>We need to make sure that forms are built for users. The amount of traffic that your website will recieve
                and continue to recieve is based on how well it is designed. We need to make things quick and easy to get too.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>One of the lead factors in designing a website with mobile factor is where things are positioned and what is used.
                If buttons are to far away for the mobile user it is more than likely that they will move to a different website.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>If ads are going to be on the website make them more user friendly as well. Reddit in my opinion does a good job at using ads effectively.
                Although I hate ads, reddit makes them appear as if they are a post. It makes it blend in with the other part of the userface.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>STOP POP UP ADS.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Although I agree that ads are a huge problem with the way some sites desgin them into, I am sure they recieve more money the
                way its done. Isn't it a good idea, if you are the only provider of that information, to make ads where you recieve more money?
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>What if my websites information is not made for the mobile user? As in you need the bigger screen in order to accomplish what the
                page has intended you to accomplish.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Some website push the mobile user to use their app for the "better" experience. Should this be encouraged?
            </li>
