        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <h1>Put your <span>dukes</span> up, sire</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> global variables are part of the window object. This is where you can store variables that are global
                to the window.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Windows had many property and methods that you can use to change the behavior of the window. It also is
                very informative to know what methods and properties are available to you.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript
                document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Data attributes: This means they're perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The navigator object: This is a global object that contains information about the browser.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> What does it mean when the book says the data attribute is private and not intended to be used by an external service? What external services would be using this anyways?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Is the delete operator used more than the removeItem method with local storage?</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
