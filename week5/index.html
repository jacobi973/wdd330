        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> For our team assignments it was interesting to see how things could changed around for better usability
                and putting it in a class.
                It help me to learn classes better.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Stack trace helps us find errors by letting us trace the error back to the problem.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>console.trace() is a feature that can be used while debugging.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All these are new to me 
                EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained
                for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.

                RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.

                ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist. For example, calling a
                function that hasn't been defined.

                SyntaxError is thrown when there's an error in the code's syntax.

                TypeError is thrown when there's an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when
                a number is expected.

                URIError is thrown when there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI.

                InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A
                common cause of this too much recursion.
            </pre>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Js example includes usage of tests using jest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> So would the proper way when implementing a website that includes a new feature that is essential to
                the website be to check for it
                and if they don't have it just give them a warning the the website won't work properly without x
                component?
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>How often do you use test cases in your work?
            </li>
        </ul>
